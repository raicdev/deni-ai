## Faster Session Loading

Session loading is now faster. Specifically, it has been sped up by eliminating loading after switching pages.

We will continue to make improvements to enhance your Deni AI experience.

## Feature Changes

Two feature changes have been added in this version:

- App: Optimized session handling
- App: Optimized Hub loading process

## Bug Fixes

Two bugs have been fixed in this version:

- App: Fixed an issue where the profile picture became extremely small when the sidebar was closed ([@ri0n_dev](https://github.com/ri0n_dev) - [#43](https://github.com/raicdev/deni-ai/pull/43))
- App: Fixed an issue where translations were not displayed on the registration page
