Hello! I am rai, a member of Zisty and Veltrix.

## TL;DR

- Deni AI has joined the student team “Zisty” project.
- Intellipulse has been discontinued.
- Deni AI will not be updated as actively.
- A paid plan will be added in November that allows for more use of the premium model.

## Announcement

Deni AI has joined the Zisty project.  

Zisty is a developer team composed of students.  

With this integration, I will no longer be developing alone. Thank you to the Zisty owner for kindly granting permission.

## Future of Deni AI

Intellipulse will be discontinued as it is separated from Deni AI.

Additionally, since Deni AI is nearly complete, there will likely be no active updates.

A paid plan will be introduced in November, allowing users to access premium models at a lower cost.

Enjoy the faster loading speed with the Deni AI v5.1.0 update.
