TLDR; Sharing, Search, Research

## Improved Research and Search Features

Detailed search has been reborn as Deep Research, providing better results.

Additionally, the search feature no longer sends all page content. This allows for faster results. (Can be changed in settings)

<small>*Note: Not sending all content may reduce search accuracy.</small>
