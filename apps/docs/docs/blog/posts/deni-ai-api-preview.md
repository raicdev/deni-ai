Learn about the new Deni AI API coming soon.

## What is the Deni AI API?

It's an integrated AI API for all services. You can use all models like o3, o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, etc., with a single API key and a single endpoint.

It uses a subscription model (billing starts from November onwards) and employs an innovative method calculated using "Uses" (explained later).

## What are Uses?

Uses are like credits consumed per request.

Each model has a defined number of Uses, which are consumed with each request.

## Subscription

We plan to release API Pro and API Pro+ plans. The features are as follows:

### API Pro

- Get 15,000 Uses per month
- AI-assisted configuration (does not consume Uses)
- AI chatbot templates
- Usage alerts
- Access to all models (can be restricted)
- Priority support
- $5

### API Pro+

- Get 30,000 Uses per month
- Get Deni AI Pro (coming soon)
- Ability to purchase additional Uses
- $10

## Changes to Deni AI

Rest assured, there are no changes to Deni AI. You can continue to use it for free and without limits as usual.

However, we plan to release a Pro plan starting from November. (Price: $5 USD)
