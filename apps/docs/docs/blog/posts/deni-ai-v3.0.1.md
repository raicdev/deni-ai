Introducing the new features, bug fixes, and improvements in version 3.0.1.

## Bug Fixes

This version fixes three bugs:

- App/Settings: Fixed an issue where detailed search could not be turned on/off.
- App/Settings: Fixed an issue in the account manager where items like 'Return to Deni AI' were not positioned correctly at the bottom.
- App/Model: Fixed an issue where tools (Search, Canvas, etc.) could not be used with Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Extended Thinking).

## Future Plans

- **Deni AI for Development**: We plan to offer Deni AI Dev separately from the main app in v3.2.0 or later, scheduled for release on 5/1.
- **Message Log:** The issue where thinking time is displayed as 0 seconds under certain conditions is still under investigation and is scheduled to be fixed in v3.1.0.
