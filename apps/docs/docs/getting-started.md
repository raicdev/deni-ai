# Getting Started

You have several options to use Deni AI: use the official instance, create your own instance, or use an instance provided by others.

## Using the Official Instance

You can access the official instance [here](https://deniai.app/).

| Feature        | Details  |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Login Required | âœ…       |
| Provider       | Official |

Currently, login is required for antibot measures, but it will eventually become optional.

## Using Other Instances

If you want to use instances provided by others, please contact the instance provider.

## Creating Your Own Instance

If you want to create your own instance, please refer to [this guide](/setup-guide/create-a-instance).
