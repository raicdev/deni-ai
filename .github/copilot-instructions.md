# Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the below format for commit messages:
  ```
  [Type]([Scope]): [Short description of the change]
  
  [Detailed description of the change, if necessary]
  
  [Related issues or pull requests, if applicable]
  ```
- **Do not use Type more than once in a commit message**
- **Types**: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.), `refactor` (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature), `perf` (performance improvement), `test` (adding or updating tests), `chore` (maintenance tasks).

I will follow these instructions to provide high-quality implementation. I will only process within the specified scope and avoid unnecessary additional implementation. For any unclear points or when important decisions are required, I will always seek confirmation.
